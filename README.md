<h2>Sprint-1 Overview</h2>
<p>
  An up-and-coming band has approached you to design a website for them! You've come to an agreement that this project will be delivered in 3 parts. You will be required to           build a website with all the required functionality over the next 3 sprints. Each sprint has a required deliverable. Creative mock ups and design specs will be provided, and        your task is to use the mock ups and requirements to create a fully functional live site for the band. For this first sprint, you will be focused on building a responsive           website based on the provided mock ups and design specs.

<h2>Sprint-2 Preview</h2>
<p>
  For this sprint, you have been provided some updated mock ups for an additional screen that will be part of the site, as well as some new features to be added. Another team is      developing some back-end functionality for the new features that you will need to use for the following sprint, so for now you will implement these features in the browser using    JavaScript until the back-end is ready. Your goal will be to make the site interactive using JavaScript, and to add a second page to the site according to the mockups and design    specs.
